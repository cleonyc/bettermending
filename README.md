# Better Mending

Paper plugin inspired by [Unmending](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/unmending) and [Finite Netherite](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/finite-netherite.99962/).

- Items that already have the Mending enchantment will no longer repair with XP.
- Mending can no longer be applied as an enchantment.
- Applying a Mending book to an item resets the "extra repair cost" that accumulates as you repair an item, thus preventing "Too Expensive!". You can do this as many times as you want.
- If an item already has Mending, it'll get fully repaired and its extra repair cost reset if you ever repair it in any fashion.
- Items that have been repaired get a little note in their tooltip to let you know.
- when netherite gear breaks, it turns back into a diamond item (same enchantments) but with the following damages applied:

Axe: 1000  
Pickaxe: 1000  
Shovel: 1000  
Sword: 1000  
Hoe: 1000  
Helmet: 250  
Chestplate: 350  
Leggings: 350  
Boots: 300
